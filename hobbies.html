        <h3>This page will show some of the things I do outside of work</h3>
        <h4>Soccer:</h4> 
            <p>I grew up playing soccer and played for UVU and Drake University in college but now I just play for fun with friends.</p>

            <h4>Sailing:</h4>
              <p>This year I sold my motorcycle and bought me a sailboat that I saw for sale on the side of the road! I've mostly just been restoring it for now, but It's almost ready to put on the water.</p>

              <h4>Snowboarding & Skiing:</h4>
              <p>Growing up in Utah I learned to snowboard and ski. They're my favorite things to do in the winter time.</p>
