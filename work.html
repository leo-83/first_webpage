    <h3>This page will tell you a bit about where I work and what I do for work</h3> 
    I work for a Financial Tech company called MX.
    <p>The company is based out of Lehi, Utah and lets me work from home or come into the office for snacks.
        <p>I troubleshoot aggregation issues to provide technical support for users and clients that have individual and widespread issues with their financial profile and connectivity.</p>
